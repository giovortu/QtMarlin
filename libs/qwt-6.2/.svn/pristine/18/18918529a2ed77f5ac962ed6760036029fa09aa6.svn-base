Qwt 6.2.0
=========

0) Requirement for Qt >= 4.8

1) Class Includes added

Include files, that match the class names are available now. So
it is possible to write "#include <QwtPlot>" now instead of "include qwt_plot.h"

2) BSD License for examples

Where possible the code of the examples is available under the 3-clause BSD License 

3) MathML text renderer removed

The code can be found at https://github.com/uwerat/qwt-mml-dev now and is intended
to become a standalone lib. Anyone who is interested to workon it, please let me know.

4) Spline interpolation

Different spline interpolation algos have been implemented, the broken
previous implementation of QwtSpline has been replaced.

5) New plot items

	- QwtPlotVectorField
      A new type of plot item for vector fields

    - QwtPlotGraphicItem
      An item displaying a QwtGraphic image ( f.e used by QwtPlotSvgItem )

7) QwtPlotCurve

	- QwtPlotCurve::FilterPointsAggressive mode added - a fast weeding algo
      for huge datasets with increasing x or y values

	- QwtPlotCurve::closestPoint is virtual now
	- QwtPlotCurve: polygon clipping includes the painter clip
	- QwtPlotCurve::setLegendAttributes added
	- QwtPlotCurve::closestPoint is virtual now 
	- QwtValuePointData added for curves, where the x values are the index
	- a couple of new QwtPlotCurve::setSamples alternatives

8) QwtPlotSpectrogram

	- QwtPlotSpectrogram::setMaxRGBTableSize added
	- QwtRasterData::setInterval/interval changed into a pure virtual getter
	- QwtMatrixRasterData::BicubicInterpolation added
	- QwtMatrixRasterData::interval: API cleanup
	- QwtHueColorMap, QwtSaturationValueColorMap added

9) QwtPlotRenderer

	- using QPdfWriter where possible

10)
	- LOG_MIN/LOG_MAX removed, use QwtTransform::LogMin/LogMax instead ( values differ ! )
	- qwt_compat.h removed
	- qwtFuzzyGreaterOrEqual/qwtFuzzyLessOrEqual removed
	- qwtGetMin/qwtGetMax removed

11)
    - Not aligning unknown paint engines ( f.e EMF )
    - QwtNullPaintDevice is using a different type than QPaintEngine::User now

12) Many other changes ...
